<h3 align="center">The Project:</h3>
<p align="center">
I wanted to learn and implement a Spring Boot Application, which was able to connect and manage multiple databases, therefore created the following project. At first that was all I wanted to accomplish, then I took it further and wanted to implement Apache Kafka functionalities and used this Project to develop it further and further.
I thought a Ticket System would be a great Use Case to implement a lot of create a complex and demanding application with Keycloak to manage User Authentication, managing it through Spring Boot Endpoints, using Kafka to create information streams and so on. 
</p>

<p align="center">
After creating the configuration classes, I wrote a docker-compose.yaml file with which I run my PostgreSQL instance (with two databases within, primary reason of the project ^^ ), Keycloak, Kafka and Zookeeper. Further I created for each Database a configuration class and defined the packages which would be the locations for their JPA Repositories and Entities.
The first one would be "system" and the second one "ticket", which had each their own use. "system" was used to store and provide database statistics and store Keycloak information, while "ticket" would store, manage and provide information for the chosen Use Case of a Ticket System, for example Projects, Tickets, Comments, etc.

I also wanted to work more on my Angular knowledge and implemented the <a href="https://github.com/yohagos/mds-ng">Frontend</a> for this Application with it.
